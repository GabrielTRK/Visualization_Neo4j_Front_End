This is the front-end code for the RRPS_PAT system, which contains the interface to solve the air traffic management problem to reduce the risk of pandemic spread.

The 'index.html' file is the main file of the interface, from there you can navigate to other areas in the system whose files are located in the 'html' directory.

The 'js' directory contains the javascript files used by their respective html file.

The 'Utils' directory contains several images used in the interface.

Additionally, some screenshots of the interface are located in the 'Screenshots' directory.

In order to use the interface you must first run the back-end server, which can be found in https://github.com/GabrielTRK/Visualization_Neo4j_Back_End
